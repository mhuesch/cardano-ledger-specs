\begin{abstract}
This document is a modification of the Shelley ledger specification
(see~\cite{shelley_spec}) to support Plutus.
It only includes those chapters of the original spec in which the
rules or types were were modified for the purpose of Plutus
integration, as well as background notation and type definitions necessary
for presenting the Plutus-related changes.

This will soon be converted into a stand-alone document once it is more 
clear how to separate out the Plutus-specific definitions.
